VMWare Horizon Vulnerabilities Exposed: hreats to System Security

VMware clients offer a robust and dynamic security solution for enterprises seeking to operate in virtual environments while safeguarding their data against both cyber threats and evolving platform vulnerabilities. However, within the realm of this digital infrastructure, misconfigurations and security control gaps have revealed three potential vulnerabilities:

1) Browser Redirection Control Bypass: Attackers can skillfully bypass browser redirection controls by creating separate profiles, thereby accessing unauthorized resources.

2) Plugin Removal Exploitation: A security gap allows malevolent actors to remove the VMware plugin, compromising critical security features.

3) Sensitive Data Exfiltration: These vulnerabilities empower attackers to exfiltrate sensitive information without elevating their privileges, raising concerns about data protection.

These discoveries underscore the need for VMware to enhance its research efforts and refine its security policies. This, in turn, would empower clients to enforce robust security measures for the protection of their critical data.
